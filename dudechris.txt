Don't worry-I haven't brunted these issues alone, your contemporary, Operations Lead Mr. Cataldo, has already met my needs with missed hours before, and again.

The course in question was IS834 actually. The professor's first name is Brock, he told me this warmly.

Attached is a screenshot from a Teams group, proving my pickup of the EC707 shift. For example, this shift never appeared in Sling. Therefore, shifts I pick up like this don't appear in Sling. 

Additionally, the EC707 Discussion TA was especially difficult, he didn't have a properly registered classroom. Some days, I was asked to join remotely when I had already walked to the classroom. Other days, as you may be able to tell, other moderators appear to claim this shift. This error is probably due to you all allowing three person's entry in .xls spreadsheets for every single shift. If three people show up to the same shift, this cannot be one person's fault sir. 

Thanks for writing, I see I've caused you some trouble and am happy to accept perhaps a few hours of missed pay. Please, I can find every shift I have picked up this semester, but I need not toil you with verifying something that has already been taken care of by another operations lead.

I'd love to work in the Spring 2021 semester as well... most preferably @the service desk, you all weren't hiring service desk last summer at least, 2020. 

Let me know if things seem to be changing for this winter-Spring semester @the service desk.

Warmly, Chase
